# Forecasting Skill Demonstration

This project demonstrates a 24-hour load forecasting pipeline using both baseline and machine learning (Random Forest) approaches. The task was given as part of a volunteering opportunity with the LEAPS Lab at ASU.

## 📈 Data Description

- **File**: `load_data.csv`
- **Frequency**: Hourly
- **Columns**:
  - `timestamp`: Datetime object
  - `load_kW`: Power load in kilowatts

Includes missing values, outage periods, and outliers to simulate real-world noise.

## 📘 Project Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Interpolate missing values
   - Detect and fix outages (zero-load)
   - Remove outliers (IQR)
   - Engineer time-based features

2. **Baseline Forecast**
   - Forecast using previous day's values
   - Compute MAE, RMSE, MAPE

3. **Advanced Forecast (Random Forest)**
   - Lag features used: t-1, t-2, t-3
   - Predict next 24 hours as a batch
   - Evaluate and compare to baseline

4. **Evaluation & Visualization**
   - Error metrics for both models
   - Forecast and residual plots

## 📌 Results

| Model | MAE | RMSE | MAPE |
|-------|-----|------|------|
| Baseline | ~X.XX | ~X.XX | ~XX.X% |
| Random Forest | ~X.XX | ~X.XX | ~XX.X% |

## 📂 Notes

- Future enhancements could include neural networks, hyperparameter tuning, or model ensembling.
- All code is organized into modular sections for readability.
- Additional utility functions can be moved to `utils.py` for reuse.
